**Hotel Reservations App**

**Dependencies**
* Thymeleaf.
* Spring Web Starter.

Built with spring boot. 

Users can make a request to the reservations page which pulls hotel room data from a SQL DB. The reservations page lists all hotel rooms and also indicates which is vacant and which isn't. More expansion coming to the web App soon.
